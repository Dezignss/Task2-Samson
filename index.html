            Hi, my name is Samson Olumoye from Lagos, Nigeria. I'm a product designer by profession, working with an early-stage startup called Jamit. Jamit is an online storytelling platform for creators in Africa, and my work and part of my responsibility at Jamit involve creating designs that help solve problems for African creators. I'm currently learning how to code, focusing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, to expand my job opportunities. Additionally, I have a strong passion for watching movies when I'm not busy with work or other tasks. I'm also open to collaborating on projects that provide value to people.
