            Hi, my name is Samson Olumoye from Lagos, Nigeria. I'm a product designer by profession working with an
            early stage startup called Jamit, Jamit is an online story telling platform for creators in Africa and my
            work and part of my responsibility at Jamit is to create designs that will help solve problems for African
            creators. I'm currently learning how to code to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript because i want to be open to
            more job oppourtunities and i also love watching movie a lot when i'm not busy with work or any other thing
            and i'm open to collaborating to work on a project that provides value for people.
